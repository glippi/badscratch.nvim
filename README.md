# badscratch.nvim
> the kind of buffer you wouldn't take home to your parents

This is a very basic and simple plugin which aims to emulate the scratch
buffer of emacs in neovim.

## how it works:

This plugin creates a new buffer named **scratch** as soon as you enter in
vim/neovim so that you can start to use it right away.

By default this buffer can't be saved, so be sure not to write in it things that
needs to be persisted.

## installation:

* [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
  `Plug 'glippi/badscracth.nvim'`

* [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)
  `use 'Olical/aniseed'`
